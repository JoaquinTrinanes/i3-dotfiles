# i3-dotfiles
My i3 configuration for Ubuntu. Includes i3blocks configuration with music, volume controls, beautiful workspaces with icons, startupp applications and cool themes.

The code is a bit messy and is based in a lot of third-parties. Unfortunately, when I started configuring everything it wasn't with the intention of making it public, but in the future i'll try to fix it, with screenshots, a list of the programs needed, correctly commented code...
